# Burger

The Eat-Da-Burger app featured on this page was built in two different ways: a version using sequelize and a version with a manual ORM system. Both of these apps utilize a RESTful API and the handlebars template system. 

Technologies Used: MySQL (with Sequelize), Express, Node, and Handlebars as well as Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery

Description:

Users of the application can create custom named burgers and submit them through the form. They are added to the MySQL database. They can optionally be given a customer name before being devoured. All database queries are handled through sequelize.
